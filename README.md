A classic strategy game.

Players compete to make a connected chain from one side to the other.
A tutorial is included in game.
Only human vs human hot-seat play is fully implemented.

ogg files placed in the sounds/music directory will be shuffled during play.
Might I suggest the awesome music of Manolo Camp.
